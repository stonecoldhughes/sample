Introduction:


Welcome to my code sample for my application for a job at ORNL!

Here you will find a project that illustrates my grasp of object oriented design,
robust software design strategies, and general coding style. I chose to write this
project in C++ because mastery of these concepts in C++ implies mastery of the same
ideas in any other language.


Project components:

1. Build system

Files:

CMakeLists.txt


description:

  In my professional opinion, Makefiles are a lot like assembly code. It's good to know how they
work, but a modern programmer should master a higher level tool. Managing a large,
complex build system by modifying Makefiles by hand is one way to do it, but I like to use
CMake to create the Makefile. It is cross-platform, supports alternatives to Makefiles if the
user so chooses, is highly maintainable, and can detect and account for many different build
environments.

Class heirarchy design:

data

vector or matrix


operations
